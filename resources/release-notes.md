* GH-302, GH-421: The `vimr` CLI tool has two new options:
  - `--wait`: When present, the `vimr` CLI tool will exit only after the corresponding VimR window has been closed. This is particularly useful when combined with the `--nvim` option as described below.
  - `--nvim`: When present, all command line arguments except `--dry-run` and `--wait`, see above, will be passed over to the background `nvim` process when launching. This means that you can now use for example the `-d` option to activate the diffmode. To use VimR as `git difftool`, add the following to your `~/.gitconfig`
    ```
    [difftool "vimrdiff"]
      cmd = vimr --wait --nvim -d $LOCAL $REMOTE
    [diff]
      tool = vimrdiff
    ```
  You have to re-install the `vimr` CLI tool in the Preferences window as described in the [wiki](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/wiki#command-line-tool).
